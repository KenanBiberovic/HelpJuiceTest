This project involves creating a web page with an input text box and an h1 tag.
The goal is to write text in the h1 tag if the input text box starts with "/1", and to write normal text if it doesn't.

To achieve this, you'll need to use JavaScript to listen for changes to the input text box and update the contents of the h1 tag accordingly.
 You can do this by checking if the input text box starts with "/1" using a conditional statement,
 and then setting the text content of the h1 tag based on the result of the check.
